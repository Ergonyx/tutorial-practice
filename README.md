# tutorial-practice
Just a place for tutorials I've done once or twice as a means of tracking practice and progress.

## LAUNCHPAD
This folder is where first attempts at a tutorial will go.  These will have lots of comments sharing thoughts, ideas, use cases, etc.

## REVISITED
This folder contains tutorials that I'd done in the past and have chosen to redo for the purpose of this repo.  Will be heavily commented as I'll be sharing insights as to what I might use certain pieces of code for or different ways of doing different things.

## DEVIATIONS
This folder contains personal projects I create with the intention of expanding on a concept or method I've learned.
